# Movie Experts - Movie & TV Show Recommendation App
Welcome to the Movie Experts app. This app uses an API call to The Movie Database to bring back movie or TV show information based on which button (Movie or TV Show) the user selects. The movies and TV shows are selected from the top trending titles of the current week. The app uses Netlify functions with the API key held in an environment variable.
